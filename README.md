Overview of the Project

Here's a summary of what I've done, along with the general steps involved:
Summary
I developed a web application hosted on AWS, which includes creating and managing an Ubuntu instance. The application utilizes AWS cloud services to deploy and maintain the infrastructure, providing a scalable and secure environment for hosting web applications.

Steps Involved:
1.Setup AWS Account

Create and configure an AWS account if not already available.
Set up billing and permissions.

2.Launch EC2 Instance
Navigate to the EC2 dashboard and select "Launch Instance."
Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI), specifically an Ubuntu version.
Select an instance type based on the application's requirements.
Configure instance details, such as VPC, subnet, and auto-assign public IP.
Add storage according to the application's needs.

3.Security Group Configuration
Create or select a security group to define firewall rules.
Allow necessary inbound traffic (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, SSH).

4.Key Pair
Create a new key pair or use an existing one to secure SSH access to the instance.

5.Instance Launch and Connection
Launch the instance and connect via SSH using the provided key pair.
Securely connect to the instance and perform initial setup, including updates and firewall settings.

6.Web Server Installation
Install a web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) on the Ubuntu instance.
Configure the web server to serve your application.
Deploy Web Application

7.Deploy the web application code to the server, typically using SFTP, Git, or other deployment tools.
Configure the application, including database connections and environment variables.

8.Domain Name Setup (Optional)
If desired, set up a domain name and configure DNS settings to point to the EC2 instance.

9. Connect to the Instance where we get a terminal access of our virtual web Application
These steps outline the typical process of creating a web application on AWS using an Ubuntu instance. The specific details may vary depending on the application's requirements and architecture.
